                    Lucky Guy specializes in versatility, 
                    able to manually select certain items from a chest (increasing his odds of receiving it) 
                    and always having the right tool for the job. 
                    Additionally, he lacks a debuff, making him a relatively low-risk character. 
                    His decoding speed is normal/average. <br><br>
                    His world is like a slot machine that he always wins at. 
                    But who knows what will happen when he stops playing.
                    Besides some basic information, nothing is known about Lucky Guy, not even his real name. 
                    He is right-handed and of average height.
