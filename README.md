My project is a comprehensive website for Identity V, a globally popular asymmetrical horror game. The site is designed to cater to both dedicated players and those new to the game, offering an immersive space to explore its features and content. With a design inspired by the game’s gothic style, it provides easy access to key features such as weekly news, tournament highlights, and detailed character stories. The website also includes a user-friendly login interface for players to connect with their game accounts.

The platform offers engaging content, from the backstories of Survivors and Hunters to explanations of the game’s unique mechanics. Whether users are looking for gameplay tips, delving into the rich lore, or staying updated with the latest events, this website serves as a central hub for all things Identity V.

## Design Process
The design process for this website focused on understanding the needs of Identity V players and fans. It was developed with a user-first approach to meet the expectations of both experienced players and newcomers curious about the game. The goal was to create a mobile-friendly platform that delivers essential information while enriching the gaming experience by immersing users in the world of Identity V.

Here is the list of user stories and how my project is the best way to help them achieve these things:
